            <h1> Introduction</h1>
                <p> The 90s Movement was like no other, it was revolutionary. From different artist coming up to 
             the fresh new styles of not only flow and delivery but also the production of beats .
                </p>
            <h1>Moguls</h1>
                <p> There were many people who impacted the movemtent in positive ways and I'm going to go over <br>
                the ones I belive had the most impact.</p>

                <p> This group consisted of five young men (Eazy-E,Dr. Dre,Ice Cube,MC Ren,DJ Yella) were some of the pionners in the 90s. They were from Compton, 
                    California, one of the worst parts of the country. <br>The group was notorious for using explicit words, they rose to fame after the release of 
                    "The Boyz n the Hood". Although this was in the late 80s they eventually they shaped 90s hip hop<br> 
                    with their music about women, drug dealing, gang activity, and police brutality which up until that point was never talked aobut in that manner.
